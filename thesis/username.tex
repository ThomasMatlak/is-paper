% Abstract

\begin{abstract} \label{abstract}
This is a short summary of my thesis, including very basic background information, a simplified description of my work, and an overview of the results.

% Vita

\begin{vita} 
% You talk about yourself and how you got to where you are now. There is a structured form for the Vita that can be used if you want, but I don't encourage it.

\renewcommand\bibname{References} % changes the name of the Bibliography

\nocite{*} % This command forces all the bibliography references to be printed -- not just 
              % those that were explicitly cited in the text.  If you comment this out, the bibliography
              % will only include cited references.

% if you have used the woosterchicago class option then your references and citations will be in Chicago format. If you have used the achemso class option then your references and citations will be in the American Chemical Society format. If you do not specify a citation format then the default Wooster format will be used.

%  Uncomment the lines below to include an index. To get an index you must put

%  Subentries are entered as \index{index text!subentry text}. You must also run the
%  makeindex program to generate the index files that LaTeX uses. The PCs are set to run
