He goes on to describe his use of computer-based algorithmic composition and how this particular approach enhances and refines his understanding of his own musical self-expression. He describes four computer algorithms, used in recent compositions and improvisations, that reflect his particualr musical interests.},

In addition to an historic overview, each chapter presents a specific class of algorithm in a compositional context by providing a general introduction to its development and theoretical basis and describes different musical applications. Each chapter outlines the strengths, weaknesses and possible aesthetical implications resulting from the application of the treated approaches. Topics covered are: markov models, generative grammars, transition networks, chaos and self-similarity, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, neural networks and artificial intelligence are covered. The comprehensive bibliography makes this work ideal for the musician and the researcher alike.},

Here we investigate how artificial neural networks can be trained on a large corpus of melodies and turned into automated music composers able to generate new melodies coherent with the style they have been trained on. We employ gated recurrent unit networks that have been shown to be particularly efficient in learning complex sequential activations with arbitrary long time lags. Our model processes rhythm and melody in parallel while modeling the relation between these two features. Using such an approach, we were able to generate interesting complete melodies or suggest possible continuations of a melody fragment that is coherent with the characteristics of the fragment itself.},

Our system consists of two modules: AutoRhythm-Guitar and AutoLeadGuitar. The first of these generates rhythm guitar tablatures which outline the input chord sequence in a particular style (using Markov chains to ensure playability) and performs a structural analysis to produce a structurally consistent composition. AutoLeadGuitar generates lead guitar parts in distinct musical phrases, guiding the pitch classes towards chord tones and steering the evolution of the rhythmic and melodic intensity according to user preference. Experimentally, we uncover musician-specific trends in guitar playing style, and demonstrate our system's ability to produce playable, realistic and style-specific tablature using a combination of algorithmic, user-surveyed and expert evaluation techniques.},

	abstract = {One of the greatest problems when using genetic algorithms to evolve melodies is creating an aesthetically conscious measure of fitness. In this paper, we describe a new approach with a minimum measure of fitness in which a set of good individuals is returned at the end of the process. Details about the implementation of a population of measures and some genetic operators are described in this work before an implicit way to evaluate fitness is given. We define a Takeover Matrix to measure the relationship between different generations and its compromise between originality and diversity. By means of this Takeover Matrix, the evolutionary process itself can be used as a criterion instead of using only ordinary individual measures of fitness. The results show the implications of using the proposed approach and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to generate good sets of melodies. The algorithm can be used not only for developing new ideas but also to extend earlier created melodies with influence from the initial population.},

Breaking free from writer's block and the composer's own limitations can be achieved through the use of algorithmic approaches to music creation. This project is aimed at development of two algorithmic compositional tools, which can be used within the Digital Audio Workstation Ableton with Max for Live software. The first employs 2nd order Markov chains to aid composers in creation of unique midi melodies. The second approach uses Cellular Automata to select loop points in digital audio files, shuffling audio segments in time to create new patterns. Results suggest these systems have the potential to inspire composers, allow them to augment their compositions, and in turn help them overcome creative problems.},
