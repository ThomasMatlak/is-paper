	abstract = {In general music composed by recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffers from a lack of global structure. Though networks can learn note-by-note transition probabilities and even reproduce phrases, they have been unable to learn an entire musical form and use that knowledge to guide composition. In this study, we describe model details and present experimental results showing that LSTM successfully learns a form of blues music and is able to compose novel (and some listeners believe pleasing) melodies in that style. Remarkably, once the network has found the relevant structure it does not drift from it: LSTM is able to play the blues with good timing and proper structure as long as one is willing to listen.},

This research offers a novel approach to produce quality musical compositions using a memetic algorithm. Unlike other computer music composition proposals in the literature, our proposal does not need any intervention from the user. Our preliminary results are very promising and conforms with MIDI protocol standards; the industry standard for electronic musical instruments.},

Because modeling music theories “from scratch” is a complex task, generic music constraint programming systems have been proposed that predefine the required building blocks for modeling a range of music theories. After introducing the field and its problems in general, this survey compares these generic systems according to a number of criteria such as the range of music theories these systems support.},

Breaking free from writer's block and the composer's own limitations can be achieved through the use of algorithmic approaches to music creation. This project is aimed at development of two algorithmic compositional tools, which can be used within the Digital Audio Workstation Ableton with Max for Live software. The first employs 2nd order Markov chains to aid composers in creation of unique midi melodies. The second approach uses Cellular Automata to select loop points in digital audio files, shuffling audio segments in time to create new patterns. Results suggest these systems have the potential to inspire composers, allow them to augment their compositions, and in turn help them overcome creative problems.},

In this paper, we describe a new approach with a minimum measure of fitness in which a set of good individuals is returned at the end of the process. Details about the implementation of a population of measures and some genetic operators are described in this work before an implicit way to evaluate fitness is given. We define a Takeover Matrix to measure the relationship between different generations and its compromise between originality and diversity. By means of this Takeover Matrix, the evolutionary process itself can be used as a criterion instead of using only ordinary individual measures of fitness. The results show the implications of using the proposed approach and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to generate good sets of melodies. The algorithm can be used not only for developing new ideas but also to extend earlier created melodies with influence from the initial population.},

AutoLeadGuitar generates lead guitar parts in distinct musical phrases, guiding the pitch classes towards chord tones and steering the evolution of the rhythmic and melodic intensity according to user preference. Experimentally, we uncover musician-specific trends in guitar playing style, and demonstrate our system's ability to produce playable, realistic and style-specific tablature using a combination of algorithmic, user-surveyed and expert evaluation techniques.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},
